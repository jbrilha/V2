# V2!

## (Neo)Vim clone in Rust
Currently VERY barebones because I obsess over details and want to implement the basic features I think of first 1:1 compared to Vim.
### Why?
~~I lack creativity~~ I love Vim and wanted to "reinvent the wheel" to better understand how the wheel actually spins..
Once I have something functional I'll start thinking about my own features.
